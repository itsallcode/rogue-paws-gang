## Background

Jinx learned to speak by eavesdropping on conversations while perched outside every place from pubs to courtrooms and police stations.

She discovered that people drop their guard around a "harmless" bird, making her the perfect pickpocket. Years of observing human behavior taught her to mimic voices and phrases with uncanny accuracy.

## Personality

Jinx is trying to go straight after a close call with animal control, but her compulsive need to collect shiny objects and her talent for misdirection make reformation challenging. She genuinely wants to help people now, but her criminal instincts are hard to suppress.

## Strength

### Vocal Mimicry

Jinx can perfectly imitate any voice she's heard for at least 10 minutes. She gains **advantage** (roll an extra d6, take the lowest) on **Smart** rolls involving deception or distraction when using copied voices.

### Distraction Chatter

Jinx can launch into rapid-fire mimicked conversations, copying multiple voices at once. This creates confusion, giving allies **advantage** on surprise attacks or escape attempts for one round.

### Aerial Reconnaissance

Jinx can fly up and scout areas from above, gaining perfect knowledge of layouts, guard positions, and escape routes. Her aerial perspective gives her **advantage** on orrientation and planning-related **Smart** rolls.

### "Just a Bird" 

Humans often ignore Jinx completely, assuming she's just ordinary wildlife. She can eavesdrop on conversations and access restricted areas without raising suspicion, as long as she doesn't obviously use tools or speak.

## Weaknesses

### Klepto Compulsion

Jinx must make a **Smart** roll whenever she sees something small and shiny, or she automatically swoops down to grab it. She can choose to fail this roll if she wants to steal something intentionally.

## Damn, That's Heavy

Jinx is a bird, she cannot carry any heavy or large objects. On the ground she can slowly drag objects as big as an apple.

### Guilt Trip

After stealing (whether compulsively or on purpose), Jinx compulsively caws and fidgets, suffering **disadvantage** (roll an extra d6, take the highest) on **Cute** rolls until she returns the item or confesses.

## Personality Traits
- Switches between different copied voices mid-conversation without realizing it
- Preens nervously when feeling guilty about stealing
- Repeats overheard legal phrases at inappropriate times
- Perches on high places during conversations
