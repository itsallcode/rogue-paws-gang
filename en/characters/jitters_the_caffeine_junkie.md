## Background

Jitters is a wiry ferret whose entire existence revolves around his next caffeine fix. Years of stimulant abuse have left his memory a Swiss cheese full of holes, but his encyclopedic knowledge of every coffee shop, convenience store, and pharmacy in the city remains razor-sharp. His mood swings between manic hyperactivity and crushing lows, making him unpredictable but undeniably effective when properly caffeinated. He can't remember his real name, where he came from, or most of his past—but he knows exactly which gas station sells the strongest energy drinks at 3 AM.

## Personality

Jitters is a chaotic bundle of contradictions whose mood entirely depends on his caffeine levels. When properly stimulated, he speaks in rapid, scattered bursts, jumping between topics with manic energy while constantly twitching and fidgeting like he's plugged into an electrical socket.

During his inevitable crashes, he becomes morose and sluggish, moving through the world like he's underwater. His memory issues force him to ask the same questions repeatedly, often forgetting conversations moments after they happen, though he can somehow recall the exact location of every energy drink vending machine in a fifty-mile radius.


## Strengths

### Stimulant Boost

When caffeinated, Jitters gains bonus dice based on his intake:
- **Regular caffeine** (coffee, soda, tea): +1 extra die on **Nimble** and **Tenacious** rolls
- **High caffeine** (energy drinks, caffeine pills): +2 extra dice on **Nimble** and **Tenacious** rolls
Effects last for one hour or until he crashes.

### Hypervigilance

When caffeinated, Jitters' nervous energy makes him incredibly alert. He gains **advantage** on rolls to notice hidden details or traps.

## Weaknesses

### Caffeine Crash

When Jitters goes more than two hours without caffeine, he enters withdrawal. He suffers **disadvantage** on all rolls and becomes lethargic and depressed until he gets his next fix.

### Memory Gaps

Jitters has significant gaps in his memory due to years of stimulant abuse. He cannot remember his origins, real name, or much of his past. He generally forgets details quickly.
