## Background

Dozer is a grizzled Rottweiler who's seen more of life's cruel side than any dog should. His missing left eye is just the most visible reminder of countless street fights, abuse, and survival struggles before finding salvation with Doris, an elderly homeless woman who saw past his scars to the loyal heart beneath. Together they've weathered winters under bridges, scrounged for food in dumpsters, and protected each other from dangers both human and otherwise. Years of hardship have forged him into an unbreakable guardian who would face down a freight train if it threatened his beloved Doris. His intimidating appearance keeps most people at a distance, but those few who earn his trust discover a surprisingly gentle soul with hard-won wisdom.

## Personality

Dozer carries himself with the quiet confidence of someone who's survived everything life could throw at him and kept going. He speaks little but observes much, his single eye constantly scanning for threats while his body language radiates controlled power. Around strangers, he's all business—protective, watchful, and utterly unmovable when he decides something is a threat. But with Doris and his chosen few, his massive frame relaxes, and he shows glimpses of the playful pup he might have been in kinder circumstances. He has no patience for weakness or whining, having learned that survival demands action over complaints.

## Strengths

### Unbreakable Will

Years of hardship have forged Dozer's spirit into something unshakeable. He automatically succeeds on any roll to resist fear, intimidation, or despair, and gains **advantage** on **Tenacious** rolls when facing seemingly impossible odds.

### Street Survivor

Dozer's experience with urban dangers gives him **advantage** on **Smart** rolls related to identifying threats or finding shelter.

## Weaknesses

### Intimidating Presence

Dozer's scarred appearance and imposing size make most people uncomfortable. He suffers **disadvantage** on all **Cute** rolls with strangers, and many NPCs will be initially hostile or fearful.

### Protective Blind Fury

When Doris or another loved one is threatened, Dozer must make a **Smart** roll or enter a protective rage, and gain **disadvantage** on **Aware** rolls until the threat is neutralized.
