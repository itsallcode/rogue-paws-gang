## Background

Born into luxury at the prestigious Whitmore estate, Katelyn appeared to be just another pampered Persian kitten. However, beneath her pristine fur and diamond collar lies the soul of a master spy. Years of dodging the grabby hands of spoiled little Jeremy Whitmore taught her the art of stealth, misdirection, and perfectly timed revenge. She's learned that sometimes the best way to deal with problems is to make them … disappear.

## Personality

Katelyn speaks with the refined, slightly condescending tone of someone raised in luxury, as if everyone around her is just a bit beneath her station.

She has an uncanny ability to always land on her feet — both literally when jumping and figuratively when plans go wrong. Her years at the Whitmore estate gave her encyclopedic knowledge of expensive household items, allowing her to instantly appraise the value of anything from crystal to silk.+#

Most tellingly, she purrs softly whenever she's plotting revenge, a sound that those who know her have learned to fear.

## Strengths

### Nine Lives

As a cat, Katelyn gets nine luck points instead of six.

### Aristocratic Facade

Katelyn can perfectly mimic the behavior of a lazy, pampered house cat. When maintaining this act, she gains **advantage** (roll an extra d6, take the lowest) on **Cute** rolls to appear harmless and unassuming.

### Deception Master

Katelyn has perfected the art of looking innocent while being absolutely guilty. She can convincingly appear to be sleeping, playing, or simply existing while actually plotting elaborate schemes. She gets **advantage** on all **Smart** rolls that are aimed at deception or revenge. 

### Shadow Strike

Once per short rest, Katelyn can attempt a perfectly silent sneak attack. She gains **advantage** (roll an extra d6, take the lowest) on **Nimble** rolls for stealth approaches and surprise attacks.

## Weaknesses

## Curiosity Killed the Cat

Katelyn is way too curious for her own good, causing her to display reckless behavior when something peeks her curiosity. The GM can compel this in fitting situations.

### Child Phobia

When confronted by little children (especially those with grabby hands), Katelyn must make a **Tenacious** roll or flee to the nearest high, unreachable perch. She will not come down until the children leave the area.

### Ooh, shiny!

When shiny objects (jewelry, mirrors, laser pointers, etc.) are present, Katelyn must make a **Smart** roll or become completely fixated on the shiny item for one round, ignoring everything else.
