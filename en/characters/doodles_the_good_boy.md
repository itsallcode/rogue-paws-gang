## Background

Doodles is a stout French bulldog with a heart three sizes too big for his already generous frame. While he may not be the sharpest tack in the toolshed, what he lacks in intelligence he makes up for in unwavering loyalty and courage. His rotund belly is a testament to his love of treats, and his stubby legs have never stopped him from charging headfirst into danger to protect those he cares about. Despite his fierce protective instincts, he's still just a good boy who wants belly rubs and affirmation.

Doodles lives with the Johnson family, who shower him with "good boy" praise when he behaves but dramatically scold him as a "bad dog" when he makes mistakes.

Mr. Johnson carries treats in his pockets and rewards generously, while little Susie constantly wants to play with toys.

The family's enthusiastic validation creates his deep need for approval, while their over-the-top disappointment leaves him emotionally fragile to criticism. Their inconsistent treat-giving makes him believe any human might have snacks, keeping him eternally hopeful about new encounters.

The Johnsons work a lot, and Doodles sneaks out of the garden when the occasion presents itself to meet his friends. He always returns home, though.

## Personality

Doodles pants heavily and snorts when excited, his enthusiastic tail wagging so vigorously it makes his entire back end wiggle uncontrollably.

He approaches every new person with boundless optimism, convinced they might be the one carrying treats in their pocket.

When faced with anything more complex than "sit" or "stay," he tilts his head in adorable confusion, processing the world through his simple but loving perspective.
