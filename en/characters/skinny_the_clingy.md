## Background

Skinny spent most of his life as a social outcast, avoided by every creature in the neighborhood due to his … aromatic reputation. Years of loneliness shaped him into a desperately loyal friend who would do anything to avoid being abandoned again. When he finally found acceptance with his current group, he swore he'd never let them down, even if that means unleashing his most potent defense. His nervous energy comes from constantly worrying that one day his friends will decide he's too much trouble to keep around.

## Personality

Skinny is a walking contradiction of insecurity and fierce loyalty, constantly seeking reassurance through variations of "You're not leaving me, right?" that range from subtle hints to desperate pleading. His face lights up with genuine joy whenever he's included in group activities, treating even mundane tasks like treasure hunts if it means belonging.

He obsessively collects soda cans, stashing them in hidden caches like a dragon hoarding gold, both for their practical value in refueling his abilities and as tangible proof of shared moments with his friends. When unleashing his notorious stink ability, he launches into elaborate, apologetic speeches, desperately trying to maintain his friends' good opinion even while doing what's necessary to protect them.

## Strengths

### Intimidating Aroma

The mere threat of Skinny's natural defense makes enemies think twice. He gains **advantage** (roll an extra d6, take the lowest) on all intimidation-related **Ferocious** rolls due to his fearsome reputation.

### Stink Bomb

Skinny has 2 "stink points" that refresh only by drinking a full can of soda (the carbonation helps with digestion). He can spend 1 stink point to:

- Create a lingering cloud that blocks vision and makes the area impassable for three rounds
- Knock out a single target for one round (no save)

### Desperate Loyalty

When a friend is in mortal danger, Skinny's fear of loss overrides everything else. He gains double **advantage** (add two extra d6, take the lowest roll) on all rolls when attempting to save or protect his companions, regardless of personal risk.

## Weaknesses

### Social Stigma

Due to his species' reputation, Skinny suffers **disadvantage** (roll an extra d6, take the highest) on all **Cute** rolls. Most creatures are naturally wary of getting too close.

### Abandonment Anxiety

When separated from his friends or when they're in danger of leaving him behind, Skinny must make a **Tenacious** roll or become panicked, suffering disadvantage on all rolls until reunited with the group.
