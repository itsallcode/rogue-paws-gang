## Background

Once just another urban raccoon, Randy's life changed forever when a speeding delivery truck nearly ended his midnight foraging. The screech of tires, the flash of headlights, and the crushing weight that pinned him beneath a dumpster left permanent scars—both physical and mental. Now he approaches his passion for "urban archaeology" with the nervous energy of someone who knows how quickly life can change.

## Personality

Randy is a bundle of nervous energy, constantly fidgeting and twitching his ears at every sound as he scans his surroundings with hypervigilant awareness. Despite his intelligence and expertise in "urban archaeology," he carries the jittery demeanor of someone who has learned that danger can strike without warning, making him excellent at detecting threats but terrible at staying calm.

## Strengths

### Dumpster Diving Expertise

Randy has an encyclopedic knowledge of human waste patterns and container mechanisms. He can identify the contents of any trash receptacle by smell alone and automatically knows the best scavenging spots in any settlement.

He gets **advantage** on all **Aware** rolls to locate trash or find useful things in the trash.

### Emergency Escape

When panicked or in immediate danger (especially involving vehicles), Randy's fight-or-flight response kicks into overdrive. He gains **advantage** (roll an extra d6, take the lowest) on **Nimble** rolls for fleeing or evasive actions.

### Nervous Energy

Constantly fidgeting and alert, Randy's ears twitch at every sound. His hypervigilance makes him excellent at detecting danger (advantage on all related **Aware** rolls).

## Weaknesses

### Motor Vehicle Phobia

When motor vehicles are present or their sounds are heard, Randy must make a **Tenacious** roll or become frozen with fear until he makes a successful save.

### Are you Going to Eat that?

When confronted with rotten food, Randy must make a successful **Smart** roll or is compelled to eat it, losing one turn and taking disadvantage on the next **Ferocious** or **Nimble** roll.
