## Background

N-Oh-Four was born under cold lights and cataloged before she ever saw the sky. A barcode was her first name; N-04 the second—spoken through masks, written on clipboards, taped to the side of a clear plastic box that smelled of disinfectant. The humans never meant to be cruel, not exactly. They wanted results. So they built mazes that shifted every morning, walls sliding with a hush, lights blinking in cruel little sequences that asked the same question again and again: remember, remember, remember.

She learned the language of the lab—the hum of refrigeration units, the metronome click of heels, the clean snap of a latch closing. She learned routes even when the routes moved, mapping every corridor in her mind until the whole place became a song of turns and distances. The world outside existed as a rumor carried in on the coats of technicians: rain, wind, the smell of damp leaves. She imagined those things as puzzles she had not yet solved.

Fear also learned her. Keys chattering on a ring could turn her bones to ice. Shadows growing on a door could hollow her out. A closing cage taught her that stillness could be a trap, and boredom a slow suffocation; when the tests stopped, when the lights were too steady and no patterns came, she would pace and gnaw and build tiny labyrinths from bedding just to keep her mind from unraveling.

When she finally slipped through an air vent and felt the first honest draft on her whiskers, she did not run in a straight line—she traced exits like constellations, marked landmarks no one else could see. Freedom didn’t cure her of caution. She kept to narrow places and quiet hours, a little apart from others by habit and by nature. But when someone spoke softly and waited—truly waited—she inched closer, curious and awkward, wanting badly to be kind and to be understood.

## Personality

N-Oh-Four moves like a shadow along baseboards and air vents, avoiding open rooms and any hint of human presence. She prefers quiet corners and predictable routines, speaking in short, literal phrases and taking things at face value. She means well and warms up to patient companions, but group dynamics confuse her and sarcasm tends to fly straight past her.

When doors latch or keys jingle, a cold panic rises in her chest; confinement triggers memories of sterile cages and the hum of fluorescent lights. Boredom is its own kind of torture—if there’s nothing to solve, she starts pacing, gnawing, or inventing little mazes out of whatever’s at hand just to keep her mind from fraying.

## Strengths

### Unerring Orientation
N-Oh-Four possesses a flawless inner compass. After passing through a place once, she can retrace routes, recall branching paths, and point out the fastest exits without hesitation.

### Pattern Recall
Years of memory drills left her with Hatchet-sharp pattern recognition. She can memorize sequences (lights, sounds, symbols, routes) after a brief exposure and reproduce them later with uncanny accuracy.

## Weaknesses

### Human and Confinement Phobia
The presence of humans or the sound/feeling of locks and latches can trigger anxiety and freezing. Tight cages, closed carriers, and windowless rooms are especially distressing.

N-Oh-Four gets a disadvantage on all ferocious and tenacious tests if in a tight space. 

### Boredom Intolerance
Without puzzles, exploration, or tasks to chew on, N-Oh-Four becomes restless and distracted, abandoning routines to seek stimulation.
