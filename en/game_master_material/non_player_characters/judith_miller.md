# Judith Miller - Owner of Sweet Earth Vegan Pâtisserie

## Background

Judith Miller came to the city fifteen years ago with a dream, a small inheritance from her late husband, and sixty years of Midwestern grit that had carried her through farm failures, factory closures, and raising three children on her own. Her vegan pâtisserie, Sweet Earth, started as a small storefront serving plant-based pastries to a handful of health-conscious customers. Through sheer determination and recipes perfected over decades of baking for church socials and county fairs, she built it into one of Riverside District's most beloved establishments.

When Sofia St. Angelo's "protection" demands started six months ago, Judith did what any sensible person would do—she went to the police. She filed reports, provided evidence, and trusted in the system she'd believed in her entire life. But expensive lawyers made her complaints disappear, surveillance footage mysteriously vanished, and officers who seemed sympathetic suddenly became unavailable for follow-up visits.

The final straw came when Theresa Wilkins visited personally to explain why the police couldn't help. Theresa's barely concealed delight in describing what happens to "difficult" business owners crossed a line that Judith hadn't known existed. That night, she drove to her late husband's brother's farm and retrieved his old Remington double-barrel shotgun from the barn.

Now, at sixty-two, Judith faces a choice that goes against everything she was raised to believe: submit to corruption or take justice into her own hands. Every morning she loads the shotgun and slides it under her counter, and every day the temptation to use it grows stronger.

## Appearance

Judith stands 5'4" with silver-gray hair that she keeps in a practical bun secured with hairpins that could double as weapons if necessary. Her face bears the lines of six decades of hard work and honest living, but her blue eyes still flash with the fire that carried her through poverty, widowhood, and starting over in a new city.

She dresses for comfort and practicality—sensible shoes for long days on her feet, aprons that can withstand flour explosions and chocolate spatters, and clothing sturdy enough for the physical demands of commercial baking. Her hands are strong from years of kneading dough and carry small scars from countless kitchen accidents, but they're surprisingly gentle when decorating delicate pastries.

Her most distinctive feature is her posture—ramrod straight, shoulders back, chin up. Even when counting out protection money, Judith carries herself like someone who refuses to be broken. The only sign of her inner turmoil is the way her fingers occasionally drum against her thigh, as if feeling for the shotgun that waits beneath her counter.

## Introduction Narration

*Judith Miller's hands don't shake as she measures flour for her third batch of oat scones, but her jaw clenches tight enough to crack teeth. Through the front window of Sweet Earth Vegan Pâtisserie, she can see Theresa Wilkins approaching with that predatory smile that makes decent people cross the street. The familiar weight of the Remington double-barrel shotgun beneath her counter feels heavier today.*

*Sixty-two years old, and this is what her life has become—counting down the minutes until a woman young enough to be her daughter comes to collect tribute like some medieval tax collector. Judith's blue eyes flash with the same fire that carried her through farm foreclosures in Iowa, factory layoffs in Ohio, and starting over in a new city with nothing but recipes and determination.*

*The door chimes as Theresa enters, her auburn hair catching the afternoon light like burnished copper. "Good afternoon, Ms. Miller. That lavender shortbread smells divine. You know, my grandmother used to—"*

*"Cut the horseshit," Judith interrupts, her Midwestern accent sharpening to a blade. "You're not here for pleasantries, and we both know it."*

*Theresa's smile doesn't falter, but something cold flickers in her green eyes. This is what galls Judith most—not just the extortion, but the false sweetness, the pretense that this is somehow normal business. She thinks of her late husband's service in Korea, her son's deployment in Afghanistan, her daughter's work as a public defender. Three generations of her family served justice, and now she's being told to pay criminals for the privilege of running an honest business.*

*Her fingers drum against her thigh, feeling the phantom weight of the shotgun's stock. Last night she dreamed of Theresa's shocked face staring down both barrels, and for the first time in her life, the fantasy didn't disgust her. That realization scares Judith more than any threat Theresa might make.*

*"Ms. Miller," Theresa continues, her voice honey-sweet with underlying steel, "I hope you've reconsidered your... attitude about our arrangement. Sofia values cooperation, and I'd hate to see misunderstandings escalate."*

*Judith's hand moves toward the counter's edge, closer to salvation or damnation. Each day the line between the two grows thinner, and each day Theresa's smile makes it harder to remember which side of that line she wants to stay on.*
