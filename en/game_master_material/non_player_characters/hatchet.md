# Hatchet — The Alley Enforcer

## Background

Hatchet is a battle-scarred tomcat who's ruled the downtown alleys for the past five years through a combination of street smarts, vicious claws, and an absolute refusal to back down from any fight. He's a former house cat who was abandoned when his family moved, and the betrayal turned him hard and cynical about pampered pets who've never had to fight for their next meal.

He has a particular hatred for [Catelyn](../../characters/catelyn_the_shadow_paw.md) ever since she showed up in "his" territory wearing that ridiculous diamond collar, acting like she owned the place. What really gets under his fur is that she's actually good at the street game despite her privileged background—it offends his sense that suffering should be a prerequisite for survival skills. Their rivalry escalated when she outsmarted him in front of his crew, making him look like a fool. Now it's personal.

## Appearance

A large, muscular tabby with gray and black stripes, Hatchet looks like he's been through a blender and came out angrier. His left ear is torn in half from a fight with a raccoon, he's missing part of his tail from a car encounter, and his right eye has a permanent squint from an old scratch. His fur is matted and dirty, and he moves with the confident swagger of someone who's never lost a fight he couldn't walk away from.

Multiple scars crisscross his face and body, and he's missing two claws on his front left paw—a souvenir from a particularly vicious territorial dispute. He's considerably larger than most house cats, built like a feline prizefighter.

## Personality

Hatchet speaks in short, clipped sentences with the rough accent of someone who's lived hard. He has zero patience for "fancy talk" and considers politeness a sign of weakness. He's suspicious of anyone who hasn't proven themselves through violence or hardship, and he judges other cats entirely on their ability to survive without human help.

He leads through intimidation and has gathered a small crew of other street cats who respect his no-nonsense approach to territory management. His word is law in the alleys, and he takes challenges to his authority very personally.

## Strengths

- **Battle-Tested**: Years of street fights have made him incredibly tough
- **Territory Knowledge**: Knows every hiding spot, escape route, and danger in the downtown area
- **Pack Leader**: Commands respect from other street cats and strays
- **Survival Instincts**: Can find food, shelter, and safety in the harshest conditions
- **Intimidation Factor**: His reputation alone is enough to make most threats back down

## Weaknesses

- **Hair-Trigger Temper**: Quick to escalate situations to violence
- **Pride**: His reputation is everything; he can't back down from challenges
- **Suspicious**: Doesn't trust anyone, which limits his ability to form alliances
- **Grudge Holder**: Never forgets a slight and always seeks revenge
- **Anti-Authority**: Automatically opposes anyone who seems to be in charge

## Desires

- **Respect**: Wants acknowledgment as the undisputed king of the streets
- **Territory**: To expand his domain and drive out all competition
- **Revenge**: To humiliate Catelyn and prove she doesn't belong in his world
- **Security**: A reliable food source and safe territory for his crew

## Fears

- **Losing Status**: Terrified of appearing weak in front of his followers
- **Animal Control**: The one threat he can't fight his way out of
- **Being Outsmarted**: Hates when "soft" cats prove they're cleverer than him
- **Abandonment**: Deep down, still wounded by being left behind by his original family

Perfect for creating tension when the heroes need to move through his territory, providing street-level information (for a price), or as a recurring antagonist whose crew can complicate investigations. His personal vendetta against Catelyn adds emotional stakes to any encounter, and his knowledge of the city's underbelly makes him a valuable but dangerous contact.

*Note: Hatchet's crew typically includes 2-3 other street cats who follow his lead but aren't as personally invested in the conflict with Catelyn.*
