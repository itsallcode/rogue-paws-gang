# Grigori Marakov

## Background

Grigori Marakov was the fat kid with the stutter who got shoved into lockers and had his lunch money stolen daily. At 12, weighing 180 pounds and barely able to get through a sentence without stumbling over his words, he seemed destined for a lifetime of being everyone's punching bag. Then his uncle dragged him to a boxing gym, and everything changed.

Years of relentless training transformed his bulk into muscle, his stutter into quiet confidence, and his fear into devastating power. By 22, he was the regional heavyweight champion. By 25, he'd learned the most important lesson of his life: people who used to mock him now crossed the street to avoid him. Respect, he discovered, was just fear wearing a polite mask.

Now 32, Grigori works for Sofia St. Angelo because the pay is excellent and the work suits his talents. He doesn't particularly enjoy hurting people, but he doesn't lose sleep over it either. Violence is simply a tool he's mastered, like any other professional skill.

## Appearance

Grigori stands 6'4" and weighs 280 pounds of solid muscle wrapped in expensive but ill-fitting suits that Sofia insists he wear. His massive frame makes even the largest doorways seem narrow, and his presence fills rooms like a physical weight. His face bears the marks of his boxing career—a slightly flattened nose, scar tissue around the eyes, and hands that look like they could crush walnuts without effort.

Despite his intimidating size, there's something almost gentle about his movements. He walks carefully, as if aware that his bulk might accidentally break something precious. His dark hair is always neatly combed, and he maintains the habits of respectful grooming his mother taught him. When he enters Yi Wang's restaurant, he removes his flat cap and holds it respectfully in both hands like a schoolboy meeting his teacher.

## Strengths

- **Overwhelming Physical Presence**: His size and reputation end most conflicts before they begin
- **Professional Boxer**: Trained fighter with devastating power and surprising speed
- **Unshakeable Calm**: Rarely loses his temper because intimidation usually works
- **Loyal Employee**: Follows orders without question and doesn't create complications
- **Surprising Gentleness**: Can be remarkably careful when the situation requires it

## Weaknesses

- **Limited Intelligence**: Easily manipulated by clever people, struggles with complex plans
- **Conflict of Interest**: His feelings for Yi Wang compromise his professional duties
- **Social Awkwardness**: Still the insecure child inside when dealing with genuine human connection
- **Unquestioning Obedience**: Rarely thinks about the morality of his actions
- **Emotional Blindness**: Doesn't understand why people might not like being threatened

## Desires

- **Simple Respect**: To be treated with the dignity he was denied as a child
- **Yi Wang's Affection**: Though he'd never dare voice this hope aloud
- **Professional Success**: To continue being useful and well-compensated
- **Peaceful Resolution**: Secretly hopes conflicts end without violence
- **Acceptance**: To be seen as more than just hired muscle

## Fears

- **Returning to Powerlessness**: That someday he'll be that helpless fat kid again
- **Yi-Ming Wang's Fear**: That she'll always see him as just another thug
- **Disappointing Sofia**: Losing his job and the respect that comes with it
- **Being Truly Seen**: That people will realize he's not as confident as he appears
- **Accidental Harm**: That his strength will hurt someone he cares about

## Introduction Narration

*The bell above Yi Wang's restaurant door chimes softly as Grigori Marakov ducks through the entrance, his massive frame requiring careful navigation around the hanging paper lanterns. Immediately, his flat cap comes off, held respectfully in both scarred hands as his eyes find Yi Wang behind the counter.*

*"Good afternoon, Mrs. Wang," he says quietly, his deep voice carrying only the faintest trace of his childhood stutter when he's nervous. Around them, the lunch crowd falls silent—not because he's raised his voice or made any threatening gesture, but simply because 280 pounds of regional boxing champion tends to command attention.*

*Yi Wang looks up from her order pad, and for just a moment, Grigori allows himself to hope she might smile. Instead, he sees the familiar tightness around her eyes, the way her shoulders set with resigned determination. She knows why he's here.*

*"Miss St. Angelo sends her regards," he continues, the words feeling heavy as stones in his mouth. This is the part of the job he's good at—the part that pays well and keeps Sofia happy. But watching Yi Wang's face close off, seeing her retreat behind that wall of fear and disappointment, makes him wish he was still just the fat kid with the stutter.*

*At least then, people didn't cross the street when they saw him coming.*
