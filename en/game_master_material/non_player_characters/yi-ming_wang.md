# Yi-Ming Wang

## Background

Yi-Ming Wang—who goes by Ming to most customers—inherited more than just a restaurant when her parents passed. She inherited their dreams, their sacrifice, and their unbreakable belief that in America, hard work could build something lasting. Her parents, Chen and Li Wang, arrived with nothing but recipes written in faded notebooks and a determination to create a place where their daughter could belong.

The Golden Lotus has been her whole world for the past eight years. Every table, every recipe, every customer represents a piece of her family's legacy. When Sofia's people first approached her about "protection fees," Ming's response was swift and unequivocal: "My parents didn't survive the Cultural Revolution to be bullied by petty criminals."

That defiance cost her two fingers on her left hand, courtesy of Theresa's particular brand of persuasion. But even with her hand still healing, Ming's spine remains unbowed. She's learned to be more careful with her words, more strategic in her resistance, but she has never stopped fighting.

Despite her own financial struggles, Ming volunteers at St. Catherine's soup kitchen every Sunday morning, carrying on her parents' belief in community service. It's there she encountered [Doris Hartwell](doris_hartwell.md) — the older woman with kind eyes who always thanks the volunteers by name. They've exchanged pleasantries about the weather and the neighborhood, neither knowing how their lives would intersect through Sofia's web of influence.

## Appearance

At 5'2" and barely 105 pounds, Ming's physical presence might seem negligible, but she carries herself with the regal bearing of someone who refuses to be diminished. Her long black hair is always pulled back in a practical bun, secured with ornate chopsticks that were her grandmother's. Despite the constant stress of running a struggling restaurant under criminal pressure, she maintains almost ceremonial attention to her appearance—pressed blouses, minimal but elegant makeup, posture that speaks of inner strength.

Her left hand bears the visible evidence of Theresa's violence—the pinky and ring fingers set at slightly wrong angles, movement still stiff despite months of healing. She's learned to work around the injury with practiced grace, but the sight of those crooked fingers serves as a daily reminder of what defiance costs.

When she smiles—which she still does, genuinely, for regular customers and fellow volunteers—it transforms her entire face, revealing the warmth and humor that criminal pressure hasn't managed to crush.

## Introduction Narration

*Ming Wang wipes down table six for the third time, her movements careful and deliberate as she compensates for her damaged left hand. The afternoon light streams through the Golden Lotus's windows, illuminating the framed photograph of her parents on the wall—young and hopeful, standing proudly in front of their new restaurant thirty years ago.*

*The lunch rush is over, leaving only Mrs. Patterson nursing her jasmine tea and reading the newspaper in the corner booth. It's peaceful, almost normal, except for the envelope tucked under the register—Sofia's latest "bill" for protection services Ming never requested.*

*Through the window, she spots a familiar orange tabby picking through the alley garbage. Ming reaches for the small container of leftover chicken she keeps aside, despite barely being able to afford such charity. Some kindnesses are necessary, even when resources are scarce—a lesson learned from her parents and reinforced every Sunday morning at St. Catherine's soup kitchen, where she ladles out hope alongside hot meals.*

*She thinks briefly of the gentle woman with silver hair who always works the dessert station—Doris, she thinks her name is. Someone else trying to make the world a little kinder, one small act at a time. If only more people understood that simple truth.*

*The door chimes, and Ming's hand instinctively moves to cover her crooked fingers as she looks up with her practiced customer service smile. But the smile falters when she sees Grigori's massive frame filling the doorway, his cap already in his hands, eyes apologetic but determined.*

*"Good afternoon, Mrs. Wang," he says quietly, and Ming straightens her spine, drawing on reserves of dignity that no amount of intimidation has managed to exhaust.*

*"Mr. Marakov," she replies, her voice steady despite the fear that always accompanies these visits. "I assume this isn't a social call."*

*Her parents didn't survive revolution and immigration to raise a daughter who would bow to criminals. Whatever comes next, she'll face it standing tall.*
