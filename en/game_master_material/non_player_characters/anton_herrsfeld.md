# Anton Herrsfeld

## Background

Anton Herrsfeld's grandfather fled Germany after the war, carrying old grudges and older ideas about superiority and order. Those poisonous beliefs filtered down through generations, taking root in Anton's mind like invasive weeds. Unlike his grandfather's crude brutality, Anton learned to dress his hatred in suits and spreadsheets, making it respectable and efficient.

At 34, Anton has built a reputation as Sofia's problem-solver—the man who handles the delicate work that requires both intelligence and complete moral flexibility. He doesn't just collect debts; he destroys lives with surgical precision. A few strategic rumors, some doctored photographs, a well-timed tax audit—Anton prefers psychological warfare to physical violence, though he's capable of both.

His loyalty to Sofia goes beyond professional respect. He sees in her the kind of natural superiority he believes in—breeding, intelligence, and the will to take what lesser people are too weak to claim. That she's begun to notice his devotion and subtly encourage it only confirms, in his twisted mind, that they're meant to be partners in something greater.

## Appearance

Anton stands 5'11" with the lean, athletic build of someone who treats physical fitness as another form of discipline. His blonde hair is always precisely styled, not a strand out of place, and his blue eyes hold the cold calculation of someone mentally cataloging everyone's weaknesses. He dresses impeccably—tailored suits, expensive watches, shoes polished to mirror brightness—projecting success and competence.

There's something unsettling about his smile, too practiced and never quite reaching his eyes. When he looks at people, there's an evaluative quality, as if he's sorting them into categories of useful, expendable, or obstacle. Around Sofia, however, his demeanor softens almost imperceptibly—his posture straightens with pride, his voice takes on a warmer tone, and his eyes follow her movements with barely concealed admiration.

- **Arrogance**: Believes he's smarter than almost everyone, leading to underestimation

- **Exposure**: That his true beliefs might create problems for Sofia's business
- **Loss of Control**: Situations where his careful planning falls apart
- **Intellectual Humiliation**: Being outsmarted by someone he considers inferior

## Introduction Narration

*Anton Herrsfeld adjusts his platinum cufflinks and reviews the financial reports spread across his desk one final time. Each page represents another small victory in Sofia's campaign to control Riverside District—a restaurant owner's credit mysteriously ruined, a competitor's liquor license mysteriously revoked, a stubborn shopkeeper's insurance mysteriously canceled.*

*"Beautiful work," he murmurs to himself in lightly accented English, though his admiration isn't really for the papers. Through the office's glass partition, he can see Sofia St. Angelo speaking with potential investors, and the way she commands their attention makes his chest tighten with something between pride and longing.*

*She catches his eye and offers the slightest nod—acknowledgment of his contribution to her success. It's a small gesture, but Anton treasures it like a medal. This is how the world should work: superior minds like theirs rising to their natural positions, lesser beings falling into line.*

*The thought of Grigori lumbers unbidden into his mind, and Anton's jaw tightens. The Russian is useful muscle, certainly, but the way he looks at that Chinese restaurant owner... it shows a fundamental weakness of character. Some people simply lack the discipline to maintain proper boundaries.*

*Anton straightens his tie and gathers the reports. Time to show Sofia how efficiently he's been solving her problems. After all, only the most capable deserve to stand beside greatness.*
