# Theresa "The Hatchet" Wilkins

## Background

Theresa Wilkins discovered her talent for cruelty early—pulling wings off flies at six, "accidentally" breaking classmates' toys at eight, and by high school, she'd perfected the art of destroying reputations with whispered rumors. Unlike most bullies who grow out of it, Theresa found her calling in the power that fear could grant her.

At 29, she's carved out a niche as Sofia's terror specialist—the one who makes examples of people who think they can resist. While Grigori intimidates through presence and Anton destroys through calculation, Theresa revels in the immediate, visceral impact of raw fear. She doesn't just want compliance; she wants to see people break.

Her worship of Sofia runs deeper than professional admiration. She studies every gesture, every outfit, every tactical decision with the intensity of someone memorizing scripture. But beneath the hero worship lies something more dangerous—a physical attraction she's never dared acknowledge, even to herself. The way Sofia moves, speaks, commands—it all feeds a hunger that terrifies Theresa more than any blade ever could.

## Appearance

Theresa stands 5'5" with auburn hair that she styles in different ways depending on her mood—sometimes loose waves to appear approachable, sometimes a tight bun when she means business. Her green eyes have an unsettling intensity, and she has a habit of maintaining eye contact just a beat too long, making people squirm.

She dresses to impress Sofia, often choosing outfits that echo the older woman's style but with her own aggressive edge—sharper heels, tighter fits, bolder jewelry. Her clothing is carefully chosen to conceal an array of blades: a ceramic knife sewn into her jacket lining, Hatchet blades hidden in false fingernails, a stiletto tucked into her boot. She claims it's professional necessity, but the truth is simpler—the weight of steel against her skin is as comforting as a security blanket.

Her smile is her most dangerous weapon—bright and seemingly genuine right up until the moment it turns predatory. Around Sofia, however, that smile becomes softer, more vulnerable, betraying glimpses of feelings she fights to keep buried.

## Strengths

- **Psychological Terror**: Expert at finding and exploiting people's deepest fears
- **Blade Mastery**: Skilled with various edged weapons, can improvise deadly tools from mundane objects
- **Sofia Devotion**: Her loyalty makes her willing to take extreme risks and personal harm
- **Social Camouflage**: Can appear charming and harmless when it serves her purposes
- **Pain Tolerance**: Both giving and receiving—she's harder to intimidate than she looks

## Weaknesses

- **Lack of Self-Control**: Often escalates situations beyond what's strategically useful
- **Dangerous Obsession**: Her feelings for Sofia create blind spots and emotional volatility
- **Evidence Trail**: Her impulsive cruelty and blade fixation leave traces that compromise operations
- **Emotional Instability**: Her need for Sofia's approval can cloud her judgment completely
- **Competitive Hatred**: Her rivalry with Anton makes her prone to sabotage and poor decisions

## Desires

- **Sofia's Exclusive Attention**: To be seen as Sofia's chosen successor and closest confidant
- **Forbidden Intimacy**: Though she'd never admit it, she dreams of being truly close to Sofia
- **Anton's Downfall**: To expose him as unworthy and eliminate her perceived competition
- **Perfect Emulation**: To become as commanding and beautiful as Sofia
- **Acceptance**: For Sofia to see and accept all of her, including the darkness she hides

## Fears

- **Sofia's Rejection**: That revealing her true feelings would destroy everything between them
- **Loss of Control**: Situations where she can't use fear or blades to solve problems
- **Being Exposed**: That someone might discover her deeper obsession with Sofia
- **Anton's Success**: That he might win Sofia's favor and push her out completely
- **Self-Destruction**: That her own intensity might ruin the only relationship that matters

## Introduction Narration

*Theresa Wilkins traces the outline of the ceramic blade hidden in her jacket seam as she watches Sofia through the office window. The way Sofia's long black hair catches the light, the graceful way she gestures while speaking on the phone—every detail burns itself into Theresa's memory like a photograph she'll study later in the darkness of her apartment.*

*Her phone buzzes with a text from Sofia: "Handle the Chen situation. Clean." The words make her pulse quicken, but not just from professional excitement. Sofia trusts her with the difficult work, the work that requires a special kind of commitment. Maybe that means something. Maybe—*

*She crushes that thought before it can fully form. Such feelings are dangerous, potentially catastrophic. Sofia St. Angelo is untouchable, perfect, and far beyond the reach of someone like her. The admiration is safe, professional. The other thing... the other thing could destroy everything.*

*Theresa's fingers find the small throwing knife tucked against her ribs. The familiar weight steadies her, reminds her of who she is and what she's good at. Through the glass, she sees Anton's sedan parked across the street, and her jaw tightens. Always hovering around Sofia like some expensive vulture.*

*She pushes through Chen's Electronics door hard enough to make the bells jangle violently. This is what she does best—making people afraid, solving Sofia's problems with precision and terror. As long as she keeps her deeper feelings locked away, she can stay useful. Stay close.*

*"Good afternoon, Mr. Chen," she says, her voice honey-sweet as her hand unconsciously drifts to another hidden blade. "I think it's time we discussed your obligations."*
