# Giovanni Alberto Riva - Owner of Riva's

## Background

Giovanni Alberto Riva inherited more than just his love of food from his father—he inherited the weight of family history and the cruel irony of fate. His father, Salvatore Riva, ran a small waste disposal business in Naples until 1987, when mounting pressure from the Camorra made it clear that legitimate business and family safety couldn't coexist. Salvatore sold everything, moved his wife and young Giovanni to America, and started over with nothing but determination and his grandmother's pasta recipes.

For twenty years, the Riva family rebuilt their American dream. Salvatore's new recycling firm grew steadily through honest work and careful investment, while Giovanni trained in kitchens across the city, learning both traditional techniques and modern business practices. The plan was simple: Salvatore would provide the capital, Giovanni would provide the culinary vision, and together they'd create something lasting.

Then Vincent "The Bull" St. Angelo's organization arrived like a plague from the old country. They targeted Salvatore's recycling business first—a lucrative operation with municipal contracts and steady cash flow. When Salvatore tried to resist their "partnership" offers, Vincent orchestrated a cascade of disasters: city inspections found sudden violations, union disputes materialized from nowhere, and equipment mysteriously broke down during crucial collection periods.

Facing bankruptcy and recognizing the same pattern that had driven him from Naples, Salvatore made a desperate choice. He liquidated his recycling firm's remaining assets and handed the business over to Vincent's organization, using the final settlement to secure Giovanni's restaurant space and initial investment. "At least one of us will have something they can't take," he told his son, though both men knew it was only a matter of time before the St. Angelo reach extended to Riva's.

When Vincent was killed three years ago, Salvatore allowed himself a moment of bitter hope that the nightmare might end. Instead, Vincent's daughter Sofia has proven even more ruthlessly systematic in her approach to the Riverside District. Now Salvatore sits in his wheelchair—confined since his stroke—watching his son pay tribute to the next generation of the same corruption that destroyed his life's work twice.

## Appearance

At 5'8" and generously built from decades of tasting his own cooking, Giovanni embodies the Italian philosophy that a thin chef is not to be trusted. His round face carries laugh lines earned through years of hosting guests, though recent stress has added worry creases around his dark eyes. His black hair, now liberally streaked with silver, is always perfectly styled despite the long hours in the kitchen.

He dresses with the careful attention of a man who understands that presentation matters—crisp white shirts, well-tailored vests that accommodate his comfortable bulk, and shoes polished to a mirror shine. His hands are surprisingly delicate for his size, moving with the precision of a surgeon when he cooks, though they sometimes tremble slightly when he counts out protection money.

Giovanni's most distinctive feature is his laugh—rich, genuine, and infectious when he's truly happy, though lately it sounds more forced, pulled from memory rather than spontaneous joy.

- **Cultural Bridge**: Ability to blend Old World traditions with American expectations
- **Family Loyalty**: Fierce dedication to protecting his bitter, disabled father and staff
- **Hospitality**: Natural talent for making guests feel welcomed and valued

## Weaknesses

- **Moral Compromise**: Guilt over paying protection money conflicts with his values

- **Financial Vulnerability**: High-end restaurant has significant overhead and narrow margins
- **Generational Shame**: Humiliation that both he and his father fell to the St. Angelo family
- **Physical Limitations**: His weight and sedentary lifestyle limit his physical capabilities

## Desires

- **Family Redemption**: To somehow restore what his father lost to the St. Angelo organization
- **Culinary Legacy**: To build something lasting that corruption can't destroy
- **Father's Peace**: To ease Salvatore's bitterness before it consumes him completely
- **Business Freedom**: To operate without the shadow of the St. Angelo family
- **Breaking the Cycle**: To ensure his children never face what he and his father endured

## Fears

- **Father's Resentment**: That Salvatore blames him for not being worth Vincent's theft
- **Sofia's Ambition**: That Vincent's daughter will prove even more destructive than her father
- **Staff Discovery**: That employees will learn the truth about how the restaurant was funded
- **Escalating Demands**: That Sofia's protection payments will grow beyond his ability to pay
- **Historical Repetition**: That his children will inherit the same pattern of loss and compromise

## Introduction Narration

*Giovanni Alberto Riva stands in his restaurant's kitchen at 5:30 AM, watching steam rise from a pot of his grandmother's Sunday sauce—a recipe that survived the journey from Naples, his father's business failures, and the St. Angelo family's systematic destruction of honest work. The familiar ritual of cooking usually brings him peace, but this morning his hands shake as he adjusts the seasoning. Today marks six months since his first payment to Sofia St. Angelo.*

*Through the pass-through window, he can see his father Salvatore positioned in his wheelchair at table twelve, reading the business section with the bitter intensity of a man who once owned a thriving recycling firm. At 82, confined to the wheelchair since his stroke, Salvatore still insists on supervising the restaurant's operations—the only business venture bearing the Riva name that the St. Angelo family hasn't stolen outright.*

*Giovanni's phone buzzes with a text from Theresa Wilkins: "Monthly consultation fee due Friday. Ms. St. Angelo appreciates your continued cooperation." The euphemisms make his stomach turn. His father had received similar messages about the recycling firm from Vincent "The Bull" St. Angelo—first requests for "partnership," then demands for percentage, finally the systematic destruction that forced Salvatore to hand over everything he'd built in America.*

*The kitchen door swings open, and Salvatore wheels himself in with the sharp movements of barely contained rage. His voice carries the edge of a man who's been robbed twice by the same family: "Giovanni, you're cutting corners on the prosciutto order. Vincent's little princess squeezing you harder than her father squeezed me?"*

*The bitter truth hangs in the air between them. Salvatore's sacrifice of the recycling firm had bought Giovanni this restaurant, but the investment came with the weight of knowing that Vincent St. Angelo's money funded their dreams, and now Vincent's daughter was collecting the family debt with interest.*

*Giovanni forces his warmest smile, though it feels as artificial as the "consultation fees" he pays Sofia. "Papa, everything's fine. The restaurant is thriving." The lie tastes more bitter than any burnt sauce, but the alternative—admitting that the St. Angelo family owned them completely—is unthinkable.*

*As he returns to his cooking, Giovanni catches his reflection in the polished steel of his knife. He sees his father's stubborn chin, his grandmother's determined eyes, and the weight of generational defeat pressing down on shoulders that carry both family legacy and family failure. The morning prep continues around him, but Giovanni can't shake the feeling that he's cooking with borrowed time, seasoning success with money that Sofia St. Angelo considers hers by right of inheritance.*
