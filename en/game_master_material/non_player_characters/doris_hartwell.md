# Doris Hartwell

## Background

Doris was once a middle-class librarian with a comfortable life—a small apartment, a steady job, and dreams of retirement. At 35, everything collapsed in a cascade of misfortune: her husband's sudden death, mounting medical bills, job loss due to library budget cuts, and finally eviction. Within six months, she went from browsing books to sleeping under bridges.

She met Dozer during her second winter on the streets. The massive, scarred Rottweiler was being kicked by teenagers when Doris intervened, despite her own vulnerability. Something in his single eye recognized her kindness, and they've been inseparable ever since. Now 58, Doris has spent over two decades surviving on the margins of society with her loyal companion.

## Why She Can't Join Adventures

**Physical Limitations**: Years of malnutrition, sleeping rough, and untreated injuries have taken their toll. Doris walks with a pronounced limp from a badly healed ankle fracture and suffers from chronic arthritis. She simply cannot keep up with the physical demands of the animals' adventures.

**Human Responsibilities**: As the only human who truly cares for Dozer, Doris feels responsible for maintaining their meager shelter and income sources (collecting bottles, occasional odd jobs). She can't abandon these survival necessities for uncertain adventures.

**The Communication Barrier**: While Doris loves Dozer deeply and has learned to read his moods and basic signals, she cannot understand his words or the other animals' speech. She interprets their animated "conversations" as typical animal behavior, remaining blissfully unaware of their incredible adventures.

## Personality

Doris maintains remarkable dignity despite her circumstances. She speaks softly but with the authority of someone who once commanded respect in her profession. Her eyes still light up when discussing books, and she often quotes literature from memory—one of the few treasures poverty couldn't steal from her.

For her Dozer is all the family she has, and she is grateful for his companionship, though she doesn't realize the full extent of his capabilities. She worries constantly about his well-being and often shares her meager food with him, even when she's hungry.

## Role in the Story

Doris serves as Dozer's anchor to humanity and his motivation for heroism. When the animal gang returns from adventures, Dozer always comes back to her, and her simple presence reminds him why protecting the innocent matters. She represents the best of humanity—kindness without expectation of reward, dignity in adversity, and love that transcends species.

The other animals might initially be puzzled by Dozer's devotion to this frail human who can't even understand them, but they come to respect the bond and recognize that Doris's gentle influence helps keep Dozer's protective rage from consuming him entirely.

## Story Hooks

- **Medical Emergency**: Doris's health crisis could drive a story arc where the animals must find unconventional ways to help
- **Bureaucratic Threat**: Social services or animal control threatening to separate them
- **Winter Shelter**: The animals helping secure better living conditions without revealing their abilities
- **Memory Lane**: Doris's past as a librarian could provide crucial knowledge for solving mysteries, delivered through her casual conversations with Dozer

This setup gives Dozer emotional stakes while keeping Doris realistically unable to participate directly in the supernatural adventures, maintaining the boundary between the human and animal worlds in your game.
