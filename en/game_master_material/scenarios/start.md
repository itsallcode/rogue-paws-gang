A cold wind blows through the dimly lit alley where you've gathered for your morning meeting. Your bellies growl in unison — last night's haul was disappointingly small. Again.

Grampa Murphy, a frail old three-legged street dog, stretches and yawns, his gray ears twitching with concern. 'Third day this week we've come back nearly empty-pawed,' he grumbles. 'Something's changed in the neighborhood.'

The evidence is all around you: new 'ANIMAL CONTROL - REPORT STRAYS' posters on every lamppost, their fresh white paper stark against the weathered brick. Down the street, you can see workers installing something new on the trash cans behind Tony's Pizza — locks, heavy and metallic.

But it's the whispered conversations you've overheard that worry you most. Restaurant workers talking in hushed tones about 'protection money' and 'new management.' The generous leftovers that used to overflow from dumpsters have mysteriously dried up.

Your territory — your very survival — is under threat from all sides. The question isn't whether you'll go hungry tonight. The question is: what are you going to do about it?

The alley falls silent except for the distant rumble of a white van with 'ANIMAL CONTROL' painted on its side …

What do you want to do?
