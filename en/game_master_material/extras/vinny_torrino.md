# Vinny "The Mouth" Torrino - Unemployed Loudmouth

## Background

Vinny is a 38-year-old former construction worker who's been "between jobs" for the past fourteen months since getting fired for showing up drunk and mouthing off to a foreman. He spends his days bar-hopping through the district, nursing grudges and cheap beer in equal measure. His unemployment benefits ran out six months ago, but he survives through a combination of odd jobs, borrowed money, and the occasional sympathy drink from bartenders who've known him since he was actually employed.

He has strong opinions about everything and the complete lack of filter needed to share them with anyone within earshot. His running commentary on neighborhood life is both brutally honest and wildly entertaining—if you can tolerate the volume and profanity.

## Appearance

Standing 5'7" with a beer gut that strains against whatever stained t-shirt he managed to find that morning, Vinny looks like he's perpetually three days behind on everything—shaving, laundry, and sobriety. His graying black hair is either slicked back with too much gel or completely disheveled, depending on how far into his daily drinking routine he's gotten. He gestures wildly when talking, which is constantly, and his voice carries three blocks in any direction.

His clothes are a rotating selection of faded band t-shirts, work pants with paint stains, and a leather jacket that was probably impressive twenty years ago. He smells faintly of cigarettes, cheap cologne, and whatever he spilled on himself at his last stop.

## Strengths

- **Neighborhood Intel**: Knows everyone's business from sitting in bars all day
- **Fearless Honesty**: Will say what everyone else is thinking but won't voice
- **Street Connections**: Has contacts throughout the district's working-class community
- **Comic Timing**: Naturally funny when he's not being deliberately obnoxious
- **Survivor Instincts**: Despite his problems, always manages to land on his feet

## Weaknesses

- **Hair-Trigger Temper**: Explodes over minor slights or disagreements
- **Alcoholism**: Drinking problem affects his judgment and reliability
- **Loud and Abrasive**: Draws unwanted attention and offends people regularly
- **Financially Irresponsible**: Spends money on drinks instead of necessities
- **Unemployable**: His reputation and attitude make finding work nearly impossible

## Desires

- **Respect**: Wants people to take him seriously instead of dismissing him as a drunk
- **Easy Money**: Looking for quick schemes to solve his financial problems
- **Revenge**: Nursing grudges against former bosses and anyone who's wronged him
- **Acknowledgment**: Craves recognition that his insights about people are actually valuable

## Fears

- **Homelessness**: Terrified of losing his crummy apartment and ending up on the streets
- **Irrelevance**: Afraid that nobody listens to him or cares what he thinks
- **Sobriety**: Genuinely scared of facing his problems without alcohol as a buffer
- **Confronting Reality**: Avoiding the hard truth about his life choices and their consequences

Perfect for comic relief scenes, providing neighborhood gossip and rumors, or situations where you need someone to loudly announce exactly the wrong thing at the worst possible moment. His lack of filter makes him an excellent source of information—and an equally excellent source of complications.
