# Zoe Martinez - Rebellious Dog Lover

## Background

Zoe is a 16-year-old high school junior who's been kicked out of three schools for fighting, skipping classes, and "attitude problems." Currently living with her overwhelmed single aunt after her parents gave up trying to control her. She spends most of her time on the streets with a pack of stray dogs she's adopted, feeding them with money from odd jobs and petty theft. The only time she shows genuine softness is around animals—she's been arrested twice for confronting people who abuse dogs.

## Appearance

Standing 5'4" with purple-streaked black hair that changes color monthly, multiple ear piercings, and clothes that look like they were assembled from a thrift store explosion. Heavy black eyeliner, chipped black nail polish, and combat boots held together with duct tape. Usually has dog hair on her clothes and treats in her pockets. Her tough exterior cracks whenever she spots a dog—her whole face lights up.

## Strengths

- **Street Smart**: Knows every alley, shortcut, and hiding spot in the district
- **Animal Instinct**: Can read dogs' moods and needs better than most people
- **Fearless**: Will confront anyone, regardless of size or authority
- **Resourceful**: Expert at finding food, shelter, and supplies on no budget
- **Loyal**: Fiercely protective of anyone (or any dog) she considers family

## Weaknesses

- **Hot Tempered**: Explodes into rage at the slightest provocation
- **Authority Issues**: Automatically rebels against anyone giving orders
- **Reckless**: Puts herself in danger without thinking about consequences
- **Academically Behind**: Years of skipping school have left major gaps
- **Criminally Inclined**: Steals without hesitation if it serves her purposes

## Desires

- **Dog Sanctuary**: Dreams of opening a place where strays can be safe
- **Independence**: Wants to be free from adult supervision and rules
- **Respect**: Craves acknowledgment that she's more than just a troublemaker
- **Animal Justice**: Wants to punish everyone who hurts defenseless creatures

## Fears

- **Harm to Her Dogs**: Terrified something will happen to her strays
- **Foster System**: Afraid of being sent away from her animals
- **Powerlessness**: Hates feeling unable to protect those she loves
- **Abandonment**: Deep fear that even her dogs might leave her eventually

Perfect for situations where players need a street guide, witness to neighborhood activity, or someone who might inadvertently interfere with plans because she's chasing after a dog or confronting animal cruelty.
