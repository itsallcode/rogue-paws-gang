# Marcus "Mac" Thompson - Regular Customer

## Background

Marcus is a 45-year-old construction foreman who's been eating at the same three restaurants in Riverside District for the past eight years. He knows every server's name, tips generously, and always orders the same thing. Recently divorced, he uses familiar restaurants as anchors of stability in his disrupted life. He's completely oblivious to the protection racket operating around him—he just knows his favorite places sometimes seem stressed and assumes it's normal business pressure.

## Appearance

A stocky 5'10" with calloused hands and permanent tan lines from work gloves. His graying brown hair is always slightly messy from his hard hat, and he favors flannel shirts and well-worn jeans. He has kind eyes and laugh lines from years of managing construction crews with humor rather than intimidation.

## Strengths

- **Observant**: Notices details about people and places, though misinterprets the context
- **Loyal**: Fiercely protective of people and places he cares about
- **Practical**: Good at solving concrete problems with simple solutions
- **Approachable**: Easy to talk to, makes people feel comfortable
- **Reliable**: Shows up when he says he will, pays his bills on time

## Weaknesses

- **Naive**: Completely misses criminal activity happening around him
- **Stubborn**: Once he forms an opinion, very difficult to change his mind
- **Oversharer**: Talks too much about his personal life to strangers
- **Simplistic**: Reduces complex situations to basic good/bad judgments
- **Lonely**: His need for human connection makes him stay too long, ask too many questions

## Desires

- **Routine**: Wants his favorite places to stay exactly the same
- **Connection**: Seeks friendly conversation and familiar faces
- **Purpose**: Likes feeling useful and needed by others
- **Stability**: Craves predictability after his divorce chaos

## Fears

- **Change**: Terrified his familiar places will close or change
- **Rejection**: Worried that restaurant staff find him annoying
- **Loneliness**: Afraid of eating alone at home every night
- **Confrontation**: Avoids any situation that might lead to conflict

Marcus is perfect for scenes where players need information about "normal" neighborhood life, or when you want to show how criminal activity affects innocent bystanders who don't even realize what's happening around them.
