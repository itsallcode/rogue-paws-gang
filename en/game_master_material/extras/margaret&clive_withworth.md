# Margaret and Clive Whitworth - English Tourists

## Background

Margaret (42) and Clive (44) are visiting from Surrey on their first American holiday in fifteen years. Margaret works as a primary school headmistress, while Clive manages IT for a mid-sized accounting firm. They've saved for three years for this trip and approach everything with the methodical enthusiasm of people determined to get their money's worth. They research every restaurant, plan every day, and keep detailed notes for the travel blog Margaret insists on maintaining.

She dresses in coordinated outfits and sensible walking shoes, always carrying a large handbag stuffed with guidebooks, maps, and emergency supplies. Clive stands 5'9" with thinning sandy hair and a slight paunch. He wears polo shirts, khakis, and a money belt that he touches nervously every few minutes.
