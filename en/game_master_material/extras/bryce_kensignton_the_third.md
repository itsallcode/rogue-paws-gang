# Bryce Kensington III — Trust Fund Tryhard

## Background

Bryce is a 28-year-old heir to the Kensington shipping fortune who has never worked a day in his life and shows no signs of starting. His trust fund provides him with $50,000 monthly, which he burns through on designer clothes, expensive dinners, and increasingly ridiculous attempts to impress women who are clearly out of his league. He graduated from an Ivy League school with a degree his father's donations certainly helped secure, and now spends his days "networking" and "exploring investment opportunities"—code for hanging around upscale establishments trying to pick up women.

He lives in a penthouse apartment his family owns, drives a rotation of luxury sports cars, and treats the city like his personal playground. Despite his wealth, he's desperately insecure and genuinely believes that throwing money at problems is the solution to everything, including his complete lack of genuine charm or personality.

## Appearance

Standing 5'10" with the kind of artificially maintained physique that comes from expensive personal trainers and supplements, Bryce looks like he stepped out of a luxury watch advertisement. His blonde hair is styled with products that cost more than most people's weekly grocery budget, and he's never seen in public without designer sunglasses—even indoors or at night.

His wardrobe rotates between thousand-dollar casual wear and custom tailored suits, all accessorized with a Rolex, designer shoes, and whatever luxury item he thinks will impress his target audience. He smells like expensive cologne applied too liberally and has perfectly white teeth that suggest extensive cosmetic dentistry.

## Strengths

- **Unlimited Resources**: Can throw money at any problem or situation
- **Social Connections**: Family name opens doors throughout the city's elite circles
- **Persistent**: Never gives up on pursuing someone he's interested in
- **Generous Spender**: Happy to pay for expensive dinners, gifts, and experiences
- **Optimistic**: Genuinely believes the next grand gesture will win someone over

## Weaknesses

- **Completely Out of Touch**: Has no understanding of how normal people live
- **Entitled Attitude**: Expects his wealth to compensate for personality defects
- **Poor Judge of Character**: Falls for women who are obviously using him
- **Desperate**: His neediness is visible from space and deeply unattractive
- **Immature**: Emotional development stopped somewhere around age 16

## Desires

- **Genuine Love**: Wants someone to love him for who he is (but has no idea who that is)
- **Respect**: Craves recognition as more than just a trust fund baby
- **Adventure**: Seeks excitement and meaning beyond his pampered existence
- **Validation**: Desperately needs approval, especially from attractive women

## Fears

- **Being Used**: Paradoxically fears gold-diggers while attracting them exclusively
- **Poverty**: Terrified of losing his wealth and having to live like "normal people"
- **Irrelevance**: Afraid that without money, he has nothing to offer anyone
- **Family Disappointment**: Worried his father will finally cut him off financially

Perfect for comic relief situations, providing financial resources for investigations (if properly motivated), or as a source of complications when his romantic pursuits interfere with police work. His desperation to impress women makes him easy to manipulate, while his wealth makes him a useful but unreliable ally.

*Note: His expensive cars and flashy lifestyle make him highly visible, which can be both an asset and a liability depending on whether the situation calls for subtlety or resources.*
