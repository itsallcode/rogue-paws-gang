# Timothy "Sketchy" Zaggler - Suspicious Innocent

## Background

Timothy is a 29-year-old night shift janitor at the downtown financial district who has the unfortunate combination of naturally shifty mannerisms and terrible timing. He's constantly in the wrong place at the wrong time—leaving buildings just as alarms go off, walking past crime scenes during his commute, or standing near suspicious activity while waiting for the bus. His nervous habits and tendency to avoid eye contact make him look guilty of something, when in reality he's guilty of nothing more than social awkwardness and chronic insomnia.

He lives alone in a studio apartment filled with model trains, true crime podcasts, and an extensive collection of vintage detective novels. His biggest transgression is occasionally taking extra toilet paper from work, which he feels genuinely guilty about for weeks afterward.

## Appearance

Standing 6'1" with a gaunt frame from irregular eating habits, Timothy has the kind of face that looks vaguely familiar but untrustworthy—sharp features, deep-set eyes, and a habit of glancing around nervously as if expecting trouble. His dark hair is always slightly greasy, and he dresses in ill-fitting thrift store clothes that somehow manage to look like a disguise even when they're just what he could afford.

He carries a worn messenger bag stuffed with paperback books, energy drinks, and random electronic cables. His posture is perpetually hunched, as if he's trying to make himself invisible, and he has a nervous tic of checking over his shoulder every few minutes.

## Strengths

- **Night Owl Knowledge**: Knows the city's after-hours rhythms and who's around when
- **Detail Oriented**: His paranoia makes him extremely observant about his surroundings
- **Invisible Man**: People don't really notice him despite his suspicious appearance
- **Well-Read**: Extensive knowledge of crime fiction gives him insights into criminal behavior
- **Honest**: Genuinely truthful, though his delivery makes him seem like he's lying

## Weaknesses

- **Bird Phobia**: Completely incapacitated by any bird larger than a sparrow
- **Suspicious Appearance**: Everything about him screams "up to no good"
- **Social Anxiety**: Terrible at explaining himself under pressure
- **Bad Timing**: Uncanny ability to be present during incriminating moments
- **Nervous Habits**: Fidgeting and evasive behavior make him look guilty

## Desires

- **Anonymity**: Just wants to go about his life without drawing attention
- **Peaceful Nights**: To do his job without encountering drama or police
- **Understanding**: For people to realize he's not actually up to anything sinister
- **Bird-Free Environment**: To never encounter pigeons, crows, or anything with wings

## Fears

- **False Accusation**: Terrified of being blamed for crimes he didn't commit
- **Police Attention**: Convinced his nervous behavior will get him arrested
- **Flying Creatures**: Absolute terror of birds, especially urban pigeons and seagulls
- **Social Confrontation**: Any situation where he has to explain his presence or actions

Perfect for red herring scenarios where players initially suspect him of wrongdoing, comic relief involving mistaken identity, or situations where his bird phobia creates unexpected complications. His genuine innocence combined with suspicious appearance makes him ideal for misdirection plotlines.

*Note: His bird phobia can be used for both comedy (fleeing from pigeons during serious conversations) and plot complications (refusing to enter areas with visible birds, even when it would help solve cases).*
