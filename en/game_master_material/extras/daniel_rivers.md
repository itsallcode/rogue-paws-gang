# Daniel Rivers — English Tutor

## Background

Daniel is a 34-year-old who teaches ESL and literature to adults through a community college program and private tutoring. He has a Master's in English Literature that he earned slowly over six years of part-time study while working various jobs. Teaching gives him genuine satisfaction—he loves seeing students discover they can express complex thoughts in a new language—but he's painfully aware that his career lacks the prestige or excitement that might impress someone like Officer Giménez.

Three nights a week, he performs improv at a small theater downtown under the stage name "Danny R." On stage, he transforms into someone confident and quick-witted, able to create entire characters from a single audience suggestion. But he's never told anyone from his day life about this secret identity, convinced they'd find it ridiculous or immature.

He's been harboring a crush on Elisa for eight months, ever since she interviewed him as a witness to a car accident. Her energy, intelligence, and complete authenticity captivated him, but he's convinced someone so vibrant would never notice a quiet English teacher who corrects grammar for a living.

## Appearance

Daniel stands 5'11" with a lean build from long walks and nervous energy rather than any dedicated fitness routine. He has dark brown hair that's always slightly mussed, as if he's been running his hands through it while grading papers. His wardrobe consists of button-down shirts, cardigans, and khakis—clothes chosen for comfort and professionalism rather than style. He wears wire-rimmed glasses that he adjusts when nervous, which is frequently.

His posture reflects his personality—shoulders slightly hunched as if he's trying to take up less space, but his eyes are alert and kind. When he smiles, which happens more often than he realizes, it completely transforms his face from bookish to genuinely warm.

## Strengths

- **Patient Teacher**: Exceptional at explaining complex concepts in simple terms
- **Good Listener**: Makes people feel heard and understood
- **Creative Mind**: Hidden improvisational skills that reveal quick thinking
- **Observant**: Notices details about people and situations others miss
- **Genuine Kindness**: Authentic desire to help others succeed

## Weaknesses

- **Social Anxiety**: Freezes up in casual social interactions outside his comfort zone
- **Self-Deprecating**: Constantly undermines his own accomplishments and worth
- **Overthinking**: Analyzes every conversation afterward, finding reasons to worry
- **Risk Averse**: Avoids putting himself in potentially embarrassing situations
- **Compartmentalized Life**: Keeps different aspects of his life strictly separate

## Desires

- **Connection**: To find someone who appreciates both his quiet intelligence and hidden creativity
- **Courage**: To merge his confident stage persona with his everyday self
- **Recognition**: For Elisa to see him as more than just another witness or community member
- **Authentic Expression**: To share his love of improv with people who matter to him

## Fears

- **Rejection**: That revealing his feelings would ruin even casual interactions with Elisa
- **Exposure**: That people would mock his improv hobby as childish or pretentious
- **Inadequacy**: That his quiet lifestyle makes him invisible to dynamic people
- **Professional Judgment**: That mixing personal feelings with community connections is inappropriate

Perfect for situations where players need information about the community, a helpful but nervous witness, or someone who might be observing situations while trying to work up courage to approach Elisa. His improv background also makes him unexpectedly useful in situations requiring quick thinking or role-playing.
